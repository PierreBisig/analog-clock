# Analog Clock with Rotating Hands

This project implements a simple analog-style clock with three hands (hour, minute, and second) that dynamically update to reflect the current time. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is fully responsive for various screen sizes.

## Features

  - **Hour hand**: Displays the current hour.
  - **Minute hand**: Displays the current minute.
  - **Second hand**: Moves based on the current second.
  
- **Real-time updates**: The clock updates every second to reflect the current time accurately.
- **Smooth animation**: The clock hands rotate smoothly for a realistic experience.
- **Responsive design**: The clock adapts to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Works well across modern browsers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the layout of the clock.
